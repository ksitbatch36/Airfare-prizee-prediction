This repository consists of files required for end to end implementation and deployment of Machine Learning Flight Fare Prediction web application created with Flask and deployed on the Heroku platform.

Airfare ticket prices can vary dynamically and significantly for the same flight, even for nearby seats within the same cabin. Customers are seeking to get the lowest price while airlines are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible and maximize their profit. Airlines use various kinds of computational techniques to increase their revenue such as demand prediction and price discrimination. models that predict the optimal time to buy a ticket and models that predict the minimum ticket price.we present a review of customer side and airlines side prediction models.
